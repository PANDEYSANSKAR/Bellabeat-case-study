Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market. Urška Sršen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company. You have been asked to focus on one of Bellabeat’s products and analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights you discover will then help guide marketing strategy for the company. You will present your analysis to the Bellabeat executive team along with your high-level recommendations for Bellabeat’s marketing strategy \n\n## 1. Ask\n\nThe goal of this project is to define a new marketing strategy for Bellabeat company in order to grow the sales of its Smart devices. In order to do that, Smart devices data will be explored to have an overview of how the customers use these devices and have an idea of the user profile to address the marketing campaign. The analysis results will be presented to the company co founders.\n\n\n## 2. Prepare\nThe dataset that will be used for the analysis is the following one:\n\nFitBit Fitness Tracker Data (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius): This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.\n\nThe dataset is organized in different .csv files storing data about:\n\n* Sleeping hours\n* Activity\n* Intensities\n* Calories\n* Weight\n* Heartrate\n\nThere are minute, hour and daily level files. For the minute level files there are both the long and wide format.\n\nI will focus on the following files for the analysis:\n\n* dailyActivity_merged.csv → It contains information about the daily steps,    walked distance, activity and calories of 33 different users (940 observations).\n\n* weightLogInfo_merged.csv → It contains information about weight logs of different users in Kg and Pounds, as well as the Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of the body corpulence based on the height and weight of the person (68 observations). It has only information about 8 users, which do not represent the overall population, so I am not going to use it for the analysis.\n\n* sleepDay_merged.csv → It contains information about the daily sleep records, minutes asleep and time in bed of different users (462 observations).\n\n* heartrate_seconds_merged.csv → It contains information about the heart rate of different users, which is measured each 5 seconds (2483658 observations).\n\n* minuteMETsNarrow_merged.csv → It contains information about minute measures of the METs (metabolic equivalents) of 33 different users (1325580 observations). As it is defined in this article, “One MET is defined as the energy you use when you’re resting or sitting still. An activity that has a value of 4 METs means you’re exerting four times the energy than you would if you were sitting still. \n\nAs the dataset does not contain information about the users age and gender, I am going to consider that the samples have been taken randomly and they represent the whole population. Nevertheless, I will try to obtain a user profile from the analysis.\n\n## 3.

Act\nNow on the basis of my data analysis I have found that :-\n\nUsers sleep on average 8 hours a day in night hours, between 22:00 and 6:00, which is the time range at which they are more relaxed based on their heart rate.\nUsers seem to exercise more in the afternoon, which could be because they work/study in the morning.\nUsers walk an average of 8000 steps and 6 Km per day, which is recommended for a quite active lifestyle.\nNevertheless, users spend on average 47% of the day doing sedentary activities.\nFrom this bullet points, we can construct an average profile of FitBit users:\n\nIt seems that the average users are adult people, who work or study in static positions (which implies sitting a lot of hours), and exercise in their free time.\n\n\nBellabeat marketing strategy can be focused on showing to women the advantages of having knowledge of its healthy lifestyle.\n\n* Walking influences daily activity and calories consumed, so trying to reach a goal or having low activity alarms can help improve these good habits.\n* Sleeping between 7-10 hours results in a more active day, so knowing the sleeping habits can help redirect them to be more efficient.\n* High heart rates, which are not related with high intensity activities may be a sign of stress or anxiety, which can be alerted with Bellabeat products.\n\n** ALSO AN IMPORTANT PART , TO BE LEGIT THIS ANALYSIS IS INPSIRED FROM Sara Vega Piña analysis.\n","metadata":{}}]}
